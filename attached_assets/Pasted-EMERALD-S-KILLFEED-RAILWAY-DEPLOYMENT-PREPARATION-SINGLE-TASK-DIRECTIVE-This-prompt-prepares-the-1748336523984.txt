EMERALD'S KILLFEED — RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT PREPARATION

SINGLE TASK DIRECTIVE

This prompt prepares the bot for deployment to Railway. Treat all steps as part of one atomic, indivisible batch operation. No output, logs, commits, or checkpoints are permitted until the bot is fully production-ready for Railway hosting.


---

PHASE 0 — CLEAN START & STRUCTURE VALIDATION

Checklist

[ ] If .zip or .tar.gz exists in attached_assets, unzip to project root and move contents to correct root directory

[ ] Delete any nested or duplicated folders (e.g., /project/, /DeadsideBot/, /bot/, etc.)

[ ] Ensure only one /src/ structure with clear main.py entrypoint or equivalent

[ ] Validate that .replit, .env, and pyproject.toml/requirements.txt reflect current, production dependencies

[ ] Ensure bot starts cleanly with no import or path errors

[ ] Confirm that only py-cord v2.6.1 is used — discord.py must not be present


# [PHASE 0] - DONE


---

PHASE 1 — ENVIRONMENT AND CONFIGURATION VALIDATION

Checklist

[ ] Ensure Railway-compatible .env system is in place:

BOT_TOKEN

MONGO_URI

Any other required secrets (TIP4SERV_KEY, etc.)


[ ] Move config constants to use os.getenv() if not already done

[ ] Confirm .env example or .env.production template exists for Railway import


# [PHASE 1] - DONE


---

PHASE 2 — PORT AND PROCESS HANDLING

Checklist

[ ] Add a keep_alive.py or similar if Railway requires an active HTTP listener

[ ] Confirm use of Railway-assigned port environment variable if needed (PORT or RAILWAY_PORT)

[ ] Validate main.py startup behavior with Railway's process model

[ ] Remove unused Flask/FastAPI stubs unless required for deployment


# [PHASE 2] - DONE


---

PHASE 3 — RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT READINESS TEST

Checklist

[ ] Confirm Railway CLI or GitHub integration is available

[ ] Confirm bot boots, connects to Discord, MongoDB, and loads all cogs in Railway runtime

[ ] Validate external asset access if used (images/logos/sftp)

[ ] Log successful gateway connection and initial cog deployment

[ ] Sanity-check slash commands and database queries live in Railway environment


# [PHASE 3] - DONE


---

RULES OF EXECUTION

This is one task — all steps must be completed in order without premature logging or output

Do not deploy until validation logs confirm full startup success

All configuration must be environment-driven

No trial and error or speculative logic — all systems must work first-pass



---

[READY FOR DEPLOYMENT]

Once all phases are complete and verified in production conditions, push to Railway.
